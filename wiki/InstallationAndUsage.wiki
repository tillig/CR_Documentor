#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =
To use the latest CR_Documentor, you must have...
  * Visual Studio 2010.
  * DXCore 11.2.8 (2011.2) or higher.

*Note*: As DXCore evolves, so does CR_Documentor. Be sure to get the version of CR_Documentor from the downloads section that matches your configuration. If you are on the latest DXCore, you should get the latest CR_Documentor.
  * CR_Documentor 1.8.2.0510 is the last version to support Visual Studio 2003.
  * CR_Documentor 2.2.1.0 is the last version to support DXCore versions between 3.0.8.0 and 9.1.2.0.
  * CR_Documentor 2.3.0.0 works only on DXCore 9.1.2.0.
  * CR_Documentor 2.5.0.0 works only on DXCore 9.1.3 - 10.1.7.
  * CR_Documentor 2.6.1.0 is the last version to support Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.

DXCore is a free download from !DevExpress that you can either get [http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/ as a standalone plugin engine] or as part of the [http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/ CodeRush Xpress] bundle.

= Installation =

  * Make sure all instances of Visual Studio are closed.
  * Copy the CR_Documentor.dll assembly into your DXCore plug-ins folder.
    * In versions before DXCore 9.1, this is typically something like: C:\Program Files\Developer Express Inc\DXCore for Visual Studio .NET\2.0\Bin\Plugins
    * In 9.1 and later, it's like:
      * C:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\My Documents\!DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\!PlugIns *OR*
      * C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\!DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\!PlugIns *OR*
      * C:\Program Files\!DevExpress 2009.1\IDETools\Community\!PlugIns
  * *IMPORTANT:* Right-click CR_Documentor.dll, select "Properties," and on the "General" tab, click the "Unblock" button. *This is required to enable DXCore to properly execute the code in the plugin.* (It's also the most common step people miss.)
  * Start Visual Studio.
  * The ConfigurationOptions page explains the various ways you can configure behavior.

= Usage =

  * Open an instance of Visual Studio.
  * From the !DevExpress menu, select "Tool Windows," then "Documentor."  This will show the Documentor window.
  * When working in a C# source file with XML documentation, watch the Documentor window as you edit your XML comments.  It will contain a preview of what your comments will look like when rendered into end-user documentation.

While viewing a source code file, CR_Documentor provides an additional context menu.  Different options appear based on whether you are inside an XML doc comment or not; and whether you have text selected or not. These options help you while working with XML doc comments. See the FeaturesList page for information on what's available.
