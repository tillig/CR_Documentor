#summary Describes how to install and use CR_Documentor
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =
To use the latest CR_Documentor, you must have...
  * Visual Studio 2010.
  * !CodeRush 11.2.8 (2011.2) or higher.

*Note*: As !CodeRush evolves, so does CR_Documentor. Be sure to get the version of CR_Documentor from the downloads section that matches your configuration. If you are on the latest !CodeRush, you should get the latest CR_Documentor.
  * CR_Documentor 1.8.2.0510 is the last version to support Visual Studio 2003.
  * CR_Documentor 2.2.1.0 is the last version to support !CodeRush versions between 3.0.8.0 and 9.1.2.0.
  * CR_Documentor 2.3.0.0 works only on !CodeRush 9.1.2.0.
  * CR_Documentor 2.5.0.0 works only on !CodeRush 9.1.3 - 10.1.7.
  * CR_Documentor 2.6.1.0 is the last version to support Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.

!CodeRush is a product from !DevExpress that enhances Visual Studio and adds a nice plugin framework. While I recommend [https://www.devexpress.com/Products/CodeRush/ getting the full version], there is a free version called [http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/ CodeRush Xpress].

= Installation =
You have the choice of automatic installation ([http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/668a65b5-2468-4afa-b78d-8c369850e2b2 via the Visual Studio Extension Gallery]) or manual installation (download a zip file and copy the extension to the right spot).

_If you are using an Express Edition of Visual Studio, or a version of the plugin earlier than 3.0.0.0, you'll need to use the manual installation._

==Automatic Installation==
  * Inside Visual Studio, open the Extension Manager. (Tools -> Extension Manager...)
  * Search for `CR_Documentor`
  * Install the extension from the gallery.

or

  * Visit [http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/668a65b5-2468-4afa-b78d-8c369850e2b2 the VS Gallery page for CR_Documentor].
  * Click the "Download" button.

The ConfigurationOptions page explains the various ways you can configure behavior.

==Manual Installation==
*GOOGLE CODE IS REMOVING DOWNLOAD CAPABILITY.* As of January 2014, Google Code won't allow for download distribution. Given the primary mechanism for installation is now via the Extension Gallery, I'll be removing support for downloads when Google does, which also means "manual installation" will go away.

  * Make sure all instances of Visual Studio are closed.
  * Copy the CR_Documentor.dll assembly into your !CodeRush plug-ins folder.
    * In versions before !CodeRush 9.1, this is typically something like: C:\Program Files\Developer Express Inc\DXCore for Visual Studio .NET\2.0\Bin\Plugins
    * In 9.1 and later, it's like:
      * C:\Documents and Settings\YOURUSERNAME\My Documents\!DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\!PlugIns *OR*
      * C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\!DevExpress\IDE Tools\Community\!PlugIns *OR*
      * C:\Program Files\!DevExpress 2009.1\IDETools\Community\!PlugIns
  * *IMPORTANT:* Right-click CR_Documentor.dll, select "Properties," and on the "General" tab, click the "Unblock" button. *This is required to enable DXCore to properly execute the code in the plugin.* (It's also the most common step people miss.)
  * Start Visual Studio.
  * The ConfigurationOptions page explains the various ways you can configure behavior.

= Usage =

  * Open an instance of Visual Studio.
  * From the !DevExpress menu, select "Tool Windows," then "Documentor."  This will show the Documentor window. (If you don't see the !DevExpress menu, chances are you have !CodeRush Xpress installed. See below for tips on usage with !CodeRush Xpress.)
  * When working in a C# source file with XML documentation, watch the Documentor window as you edit your XML comments.  It will contain a preview of what your comments will look like when rendered into end-user documentation.

While viewing a source code file, CR_Documentor provides an additional context menu.  Different options appear based on whether you are inside an XML doc comment or not; and whether you have text selected or not. These options help you while working with XML doc comments. See the FeaturesList page for information on what's available.

= Intranet Settings =
CR_Documentor hosts a tiny web server to display your documentation preview. To display properly, you need to allow the script in that preview to run, which may mean you need to enable intranet settings in Internet Explorer. *If you get prompted to enable Intranet Settings, please do.*

= Toggle the Window via Keyboard =
If you'd rather show/hide the CR_Documentor window using a keyboard shortcut, you can do that, too.

  # Press `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+O` to open the !CodeRush options menu.
  # In the tree view on the left, expand the "IDE" node and select "Shortcuts."
  # Click the small "A" button at the top of the options window to create a new keyboard shortcut.
  # Press the key combination that you would like to use for displaying the CR_Documentor window. For example, `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D`
  # In the "Command" dropdown, select "Toggle CR_Documentor Window."
  # Click "OK" to save the command and close the options window.

Now you can use the keyboard shortcut to show/hide the CR_Documentor window rather than the !DevExpress "Tool Windows" menu.

= !CodeRush Xpress =
By default the free !CodeRush Xpress does not display the !DevExpress menu in Visual Studio. There are [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2878437/how-to-display-coderush-menu-item-in-vs instructions on getting this menu to appear] though it may be simpler to assign a keyboard shortcut to toggle the CR_Documentor window. Use the instructions above to set up a keyboard shortcut.
